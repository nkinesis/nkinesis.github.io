                                (XR), serious games, and accessibility. In this post, I summarize the papers presented
                                and discussions held during the three-day conference and explain why research in

                            <p class="paragraph">Serious games are games created with purposes other than pure
                                entertainment. For example, the game <a
                                    href="https://www.mobility-online.de/was-ist-mobility/screenshots"
                                    rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Mobility</a> was created to teach
                                planning and construction of
                                public transport systems. Although used to teach or raise awareness about a topic,
                                serious games can (and should) be fun too. The problem is that many of these games end
                                up being abandoned by their creators and falling into obsolescence, a phenomenon known
                                as "software aging."</p>
                            <p class="paragraph">We opened the first workshop of the conference, entitled <a
                                    href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-99-8248-6_36"

                                debating the reasons for serious game aging in academia. Many of them are developed by
                                master's and doctoral students, who end up leaving their projects behind after finishing
                                their studies. Even when other researchers try to continue these projects, the lack of
                                software documentation and flexibility make the process very time-consuming and
                                error-prone. After the discussions, we proposed several ways to mitigate these issues:
                            </p>
                            <ul class="paragraph">
                                <li>Create serious games with built-in extension mechanisms (e.g. plugin support).</li>
                                <li>Create free, public databases with reusable assets (e.g., images, sounds, and
                                    animations).</li>
                                <li>Motivate developers of serious games to create open source projects, allowing more
                                    people to collaborate for their continuity and evolution.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p class="paragraph">Although we can apply these and other strategies to increase the
                                durability of serious games, the fact is that no piece of software lasts forever. As
                                Ioana Stefan (ATS, Romania) mentioned in her presentation during the workshop: "games
                                age, and so do us". There is no magic formula to determine if a serious game is too
                                obsolete or if it is still worth investing in. In any case, the study and application of
                                disciplines such as Software Architecture and UI/UX can help game developers both in
                                academia and in industry.</p>

                                recent years, thanks to games like Pokémon Go and Beat Saber. However, as I mentioned <a

                                yet "taken off" in the video game world, both because of the high cost of virtual
                                reality headsets and "cybersickness", the nausea and dizziness many
                                people feel when wearing this kind of equipment.</p>
                            <p class="paragraph">In contrast, XR seems to be finding more and more space in the

                                    adopting a cross-disciplinary approach</a>, Dr. Ekaterina Prasolova-Førland (NTNU,
                                Norway) presented virtual reality projects that introduce young people to professional
                                activities that they might be afraid to try in real life, such as changing a light bulb
                                at the top of a wind turbine, operating a forklift or working on the production line of
                                a fishery.</p>
                            <p class="paragraph">Also with professional training in mind, Dr. Thiago Porcino (PUC-Rio,
                                Brazil) presented some examples during his XR experiences workshop related to the naval
                                industry. For example, virtual reality experiences are already being used to train
                                people to perform maintenance in vessels offshore, or to visualize the movement of vessels.
                            </p>
                            <p class="paragraph">I found incredible the high level of immersion, engagement, and fun that
                                these experiences provide. Whether the goal is to train people to perform
                                complex tasks or to help young people who are entering the job market, extended reality
                                has strong educational potential and I believe it will become popular in the near
                                future.</p>

                            <p class="paragraph">This year, the topic of accessibility was on the spotlight both in IFIP-ICEC's paper sessions and in its Student Game Competition. For example, in the article <a

                                Germany) show that serious games created for teaching engineering contain few
                                accessibility options and often use color schemes that make them difficult for colorblind

                                mechanisms in games does not only mean helping people with disabilities, but also
                                adapting to everyone's needs. In the article <a

                                Masuch (Univ. of Duisburg-Essen, Germany) study a phenomenon called "collision anxiety",
                                the fear that players have of colliding with furniture or other obstacles while wearing a
                                virtual reality headset. The researchers conducted an experiment to determine whether
                                this fear is greater in virtual reality or augmented reality games, and concluded that
                                the type of technology has no influence in this aspect. However, more immersive games
                                tend to cause greater collision anxiety.</p>

                            <p class="paragraph">Bologna is a beautiful city, full of history and, in my humble opinion,
                                the perfect place for a conference like IFIP-ICEC. It was amazing to have once again had
                                the opportunity to exchange experiences with people from all over the world who, like
                                me, love games and interactive experiences. In each researcher's work, I see games
                                consolidating themselves not only as forms of entertainment but also as tools that help
                                humanity to teach, learn, work, create and have fun. This inspires me
                                to continue my academic journey.</p>
                            <p class="paragraph">I would also like to make an honorable mention to the strength of the Brazilian community at IFIP-ICEC. There were dozens of Brazilian
                                researchers presenting articles and games this year, which shows that, contrary to what
                                many argue, Brazilian researchers are capable of producing science at a very high
                                level, as well as being recognized worldwide. And not by coincidence, in 2024 IFIP-ICEC
                                will be in Manaus, Brazil! Unfortunately I still don't know what my schedule will be
                                like next year, but it would be an honor to be able to participate once again.
                                Arrivederci!</p>
