                                people who have closely followed my research journey in recent years: my supervisor,
                                Dr.Yann-Gaël Guéhéneuc, who made possible my trip and stay in Bremen; my co-supervisor,
                                Dr. Fabio Petrillo, and my colleague Dr. Cristiano Politowski, who introduced me to
                                video game research and who now follow me through the unexplored waters of architecture
                                and taxonomy of game engines.</p>

                            <p class="paragraph"> Several works at IFIP-ICEC have been dedicated to studying the
                                relationship between games and emotions. For example, Gary Wagener and André Melzer
                                (University of Luxembourg), in their article entitled <a class="au sa"
                                    href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-20212-4_2"
                                    rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Comfortably Numb? Violent Video Games
                                    and Their Effects on Aggression, Mood, and Pain-Related Responses</a> conducted
                                experiments to measure the mood, aggression, and pain tolerance of 66 participants
                                before and after they played Manhunt 2 (a game with scenes of aggression and executions)
                                and Wii Sports Resort (a casual sports game). Although none of the games increased the
                                participants' aggression or pain tolerance, most people stated that their mood was
                                negatively affected by the violent game.</p>
                            <p class="paragraph">This result seems counter-intuitive, doesn't it? If games are
                                entertainment, and if we seek entertainment as a way to improve our mood, why are so
                                many players reporting a bad mood? The authors say these results are in line with other
                                studies in the area, but they admit that the game chosen for the experiment may have
                                made a difference. In Manhunt 2, you play as a fugitive from an asylum who kills
                                everyone in his path. The feeling this gives the player is very different from, for
                                example, playing as a demigod in God of War or a soldier in Call of Duty. I don't know
                                if this is the authors' intention, but I think it would be interesting to repeat the
                                experiment comparing reactions to different games.</p>
                            <p class="paragraph">Another factor that directly affects the mood of players is fatigue.

                                players how they felt before and after sessions game with an average duration of 2.3
                                hours. The researchers concluded that the players' performance decreased after 5 games
                                and that negative feelings were more frequently reported at these times.</p>
                            <p class="paragraph"> On the other hand, games can also be a tool to help control negative
                                feelings. In the article <a class="au sa"

                                apply the anger management techniques learned in the game in real life. Although
                                psychology is not my field, I really liked the idea and I think interactive media has a

                                Meta (formerly Facebook).On the first day of the event, Brazilians Esteban Clua (UFF)
                                and Thiago Porcino (Dalhousie University) presented a tutorial named <a class="au sa"

                                for creating content and experiences on the platform.</p>
                            <p class="paragraph"> According to them, the platform is growing and Meta is working hard
                                to show the market that it is a good investment. According to statistics presented in <a

                                technological point of view, popular game engines such as Unity and Unreal already have
                                support for creating VR and XR experiences and companies such as Nvidia are encouraging
                                the adoption of standards such as the USD (Universal Scene Description), stating that
                                the format has potential to become the <a class="au sa"

                            <p class="paragraph">But if the metaverse is profitable and technologically viable, why
                                isn't it largely adopted yet? Perhaps the biggest challenge are the virtual reality
                                headsets. In addition to causing nausea and eye strain in many people, the equipment is
                                still expensive and has battery and performance limitations. Fortunately, the more
                                modern models have become more comfortable thanks to the <a class="au sa"

                                price, however, remains prohibitive for most of the public. </p>
                            <p class="paragraph">Even if the metaverse takes off, we don't know how Meta will manage
                                it, nor the exact benefits and harms it may bring to society. In a round of discussion
                                after the tutorial, several people expressed their concern about the metaverse's
                                excessive focus on profit generation. While the platform needs to be financially
                                sustainable, it must not neglect the well-being, privacy and freedom of its users.</p>

                            <p class="paragraph"> Believe it or not, what you just read was just the tip of the
                                IFIP-ICEC iceberg. I watched presentations and talked to people about many other topics,
                                some more familiar like HCI (Human-Computer Interaction) and accessibility, others
                                totally new to me like DGBL (Digital Game-Based Learning) and psychology. As I mentioned
                                before, I love being in this intersection of topics and I think the academic community
                                gains a lot from this exchange of experiences. </p>
                            <p class="paragraph">If you want to know more about these subjects, read the articles I
                                cited here. As for my stay
                                in Bremen, it was an amazing experience!
                                The city has an excellent public transportation system (I took the bus and tram several
                                times), in addition to a pleasant weather, beautiful parks and of course, great beers.
                                My next stop is in Lille, France, where I will visit a research
                                center.
                                But that's a topic for another post! See you soon.</p>
